	<p>All Structure Group Ltd, provides a complete range of steel erection and construction related services to a diverse client base. Family orientated team work, our desire for client satisfaction and our distinct individualized project management approach, coupled with our prioritized corporate safety policy is the basis of our company’s’ success.</p>
	<p>Centrally located in Alberta, the company has gained recognition and experience in steel erecting, Pre-engineered buildings, and building construction for both large and small scale projects in the Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional Sectors.</p>
	<p>Since our company’s inception, All Structure Group Ltd has grown steadily with our hands on approach and “one source of accountability” standard. Our distinct way of project management and capable personnel contribute to our ability of being responsible and on schedule every step of the project.</p>
	<p>In 2014, in order to become a more accountable and accredited company, All Structure Group LTD is endeavoring to obtain our COR (Certificate of Recognition), an industry standard way of having our distinct corporate safety policy certified. This ensures a second to none way of safe work practices being consistent across all of our projects. Safe work practices and procedures is our number one goal.</p>
	<p>All Structure Group Ltd has an ever growing attention to an innovative and distinct way of operating green, and its management team is actively pursuing LEEDS-AP Certification. All Structure Group LTD will be part of the Canada Green Building Council by end of 2014. Although we are not a General Contractor, we strongly believe that operating at LEEDS industry standards helps not only our company be more efficient in use of materials, but our impact on the environment is greatly reduced.</p>
